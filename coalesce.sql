/* 

The COALESCE function in SQL is used to return the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions. 
It is often used to handle NULL values in queries, providing a way to substitute them with a specified default value.

--COALESCE can take multiple arguments, and it evaluates each in order until it finds a non-NULL value.
